# PATS
PowerShell Acceptance Testing System

## What's this?
PATS [will...] be a test framework analgous to the much-loved [BATS](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) for Unix-like OSs.

## Syntax?
Still have a lot to learn about PowerShell, syntax will aim to be as close to BATS as possible but may need to be bent to requirements somewhat. There is DSL support in PowerShell which there are plans to leverage.

## Support?
No support yet due to lack of any code ;-). If your interested in sponsoring development please email sales@declarativesystems.com to start the conversation.

## Helps?
If you'd like to help on this project, that would be awesome. Tickets, PRs, general feedback, etc. all gratefully received.
